    "1. find an (a) \"amusing, funny, or otherwise interesting dataset\" which (b) has missing values and is (c) available online through a URL link to a csv file;\n",
    "2. load the data into the notebook with `pandas` and get \"missing data counts\" for the dataset;\n",

    "> \n",
    "> 1. ChatBots have a notoriously \"short term memory\"; so, be ready for them to \"forget\" specific details of your prompting requests \n",
    "> 2. ChatBots often cannot pivot away substantially from initial answers; so, be ready for your efforts at follow up and correction with the ChatBot to prove frustratingly futile (which, may in this case actually have a lot to do with the following fact, that...)\n",
    "> 3. ChatBots don't seem to be very aware of the contents of datasets that are avalable online (or even working url links where datasets are); so, ChatBot are not currently a substitue for exploring dataset repository such as [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) (or other data repositiory resources) and reviewing data yourself (although, ChatBot interactions can nonetheless be help with brainstorm dataset ideas and provide a way to \"search for content\", perhaps especially when referencing a specific website in the conversation)<br><br>\n",

Successes and failures are found within the Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT ChatBots both, suggesting the quality of the results likely has to do more with \"randomness\" and perhaps the nature of the prompting and engagement as opposed to the actual ChatBot version being used...\n",

    "#### 3. *[About 7 of the 45 minutes]* Demonstrate saving your python jupyter notebook in your own account and \"repo\" on [github.com](https://github.com), and sharing (a) notebook links, (b), ChatBot transcript log links, (c) ChatBot summaries through a piazza post and a Quercus announcement (so students can use this later for their homework assignment if they wish)<br><br>\n"
